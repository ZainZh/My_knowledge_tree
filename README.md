# My_knowledge_tree

I am newer to RL and Robotics. This is my private growing Knowledge tree. This repo is made up of PAPERS and PROJECT. And I try to use this repo to record my own process of growing up.

This is ONLY my own basic knowledge study record. Because of the limitations of my knowledge, there are maybe some mistakes. I will fix them as soon as possible. If you have some advice, please feel free to contact me!

Always on the way, and be curious!
